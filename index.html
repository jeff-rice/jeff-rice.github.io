        <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>

        <p>
          My love for bowling began when I was a kid, and it’s only deepened over the years. I’ve spent countless hours on the lanes, learning both classic techniques and developing a few unique ones of my own.
        </p>
        <p>
          My biggest reward, though, is sharing that passion with others. Whether you’re picking up a bowling ball for the first time or looking to refine your skills, I’m here to guide you with personalized coaching every step of the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Combining proven techniques with engaging, innovative methods, I aim to make each session as enjoyable as it is effective. For me, bowling isn’t just a game—it’s a way to bring people together and support their growth, and that’s the heart of my approach to coaching.
