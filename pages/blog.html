                <p>
                  As a high school bowling coach, one of the most important—and often overlooked—skills I emphasize with
                  my athletes is spare shooting. I've even dedicated entire practices to it. The challenge? Spares just
                  don't carry the same thrill as throwing strike after strike. But if you want to be a better bowler,
                  consistently converting spares is one of the fastest ways to level up your game.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here's why I focus so much on it:
                </p>

                <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Small Changes, Big Impact</h3>
                <p>
                  Closing just one more frame per game can boost your score by up to 20 pins. Over the course of a
                  series, that can mean a 10–15 pin improvement to your average. That kind of bump adds up quickly and
                  can make a huge difference in tight matches.
                </p>

                <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Spares Build Better Bowlers</h3>
                <p>
                  Practicing spares sharpens key fundamentals like targeting, lane adjustments, and visualization. You
                  might not be focused on hitting a perfect breakpoint or tracking ball motion through the pin deck, but
                  you <em>do</em> need to think critically about your angles and make purposeful adjustments—especially
                  when dealing with multi-pin leaves. That includes tough splits like the Big Four (4-6-7-10), the 7-10
                  split, or the Greek Church (4-6-7-9-10). In those cases, the goal isn't necessarily to convert the
                  spare—though it's great if you do—but to maximize pin count. Getting two or three pins is always
                  better than walking away with an open frame.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Spare shooting forces you to use the whole lane and think critically about your execution. As
                  <em>Bowler's Journal</em> puts it, "Making various spares requires throwing the ball toward all
                  sections of the pindeck... being able to visually assess where the ball is on the lane is a very
                  important asset" (<em>Spare Shooting: A Master Class</em>, March 2025, p. 24).
                </p>

                <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Even the Pros Rely on Spares</h3>
                <p>
                  In the same article, the <em>Journal</em> highlights how critical spare shooting is—even at the
                  highest levels. During the PBA's 2025 Delaware Classic, several players averaged over 240 per game,
                  yet avoiding open frames still proved to be a major factor in their success. Strikes might light up
                  the scoreboard, but it's spare conversions that hold your game together.
                </p>

                <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Finding What Works</h3>
                <p>
                  There are many schools of thought when it comes to spare shooting: use a plastic ball, try urethane,
                  or even learn a backup shot (though I don't recommend the last one—long-term wrist health matters). My
                  rule of thumb? Use whatever method you can repeat safely and consistently. But no matter what you
                  choose, there's no shortcut: you have to put in the practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Norm Duke—one of my all-time favorite bowlers—didn't use a spare ball. He had mastered his release so
                  well that he could pick up spares with his strike ball. And while I doubt he perfected that overnight
                  (Norm, if you did, my apologies), it took serious work to develop that level of control and
                  consistency.
                </p>

                <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">My Approach</h3>
                <p>
                  Personally, I go with a plastic ball. For me, it simplifies things—I don't want to factor in lane
                  transitions or ball motion variables more than I have to. I know my target, I know the shot I want to
                  make, and if I execute properly, I trust the spare will fall. Some might call it lazy—I call it
                  repeatable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One day at practice, I was lining up for a 10-pin and turned around immediately after my release
                  because I <em>knew</em> it was good. My bowlers stared at me like I was crazy, but I told them: with
                  enough practice, you'll know when you've thrown a good ball. That kind of confidence only comes from
                  reps.
                </p>

                <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Why It Matters</h3>
                <p>
                  Let's face it—most of us aren't bowling 300 games every time out. For the average league bowler, the
                  odds of a perfect game are around 1 in 11,500. So unless perfection is your norm, you <em>have</em> to
                  be able to pick up spares. That's where consistency lives. That's where games are won—or lost.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's an old saying, but it holds true: <strong>Strikes win games, spares win championships.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                  One of the greatest joys in my coaching and personal life has been watching my daughter, Addyson, grow
                  up immersed in the world of bowling. From her earliest days on the lanes with bumpers to the
                  impressive accomplishments she's earned as a young competitor, her journey has been full of memories
                  that remind me why I love this sport—and why I'm committed to sharing it with others.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Addyson has earned her place in the bowling community. She's a two-time Sectional Champion for high
                  school girls, a two-time Jr. Gold qualifier, KYSTS plastic ball champion, and an all-city team honoree
                  for the past two years. Now, as the captain of her high school team, she leads others with the same
                  determination and love for the game that I've seen in her from the start. But beyond the titles and
                  trophies, it's the moments we've shared on the road and at the lanes that have defined her journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We've traveled all over Indiana for tournaments, with some stops in Kentucky, each trip an adventure
                  filled with excitement, preparation, and that unique anticipation only a bowling tournament can bring.
                  These journeys have given us opportunities to explore new places and face different competitors,
                  adding a layer of experience that's been invaluable in her development.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One trip, however, stands out more than most. We traveled to Elkhart, Indiana, for a grueling
                  eliminator-style tournament. The format was demanding: six games to start, with cuts after every
                  round—six games, then four, then two, all the way to a final step-ladder for the top four. Addyson
                  bowled her heart out, advancing through every cut, but by the later rounds, the fatigue was visible.
                  She'd glance at me between frames with a look that said, I'm ready for this to be over. But each time,
                  they'd call the names for the next round, and there she was, still in the running.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She pushed through that day, finishing in an impressive third place. Although it's not an experience
                  she likes to revisit, it's a testament to her resilience. She and her friend, who was also competing,
                  joked afterward that they'd experienced a "mental breakdown" together due to the exhaustion—a bonding
                  moment that sealed their friendship. That day may have been physically and mentally challenging, but
                  it's one of those stories we look back on with a mix of pride and humor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These experiences have been more than milestones in her competitive journey; they've been powerful
                  moments in our relationship and in her growth as an athlete. I'm proud of her accomplishments, but
                  even more, I'm proud of her determination, her willingness to push through tough days, and her love
                  for the sport.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As her high school coach for the past three years, I feel privileged to be part of her journey and to
                  see how far she's come. Each tournament, each road trip, and each frame she bowls are memories I'll
                  cherish. It's my hope that her journey inspires other young bowlers to embrace the sport with the same
                  passion and resilience that she brings to the lanes.
                </p>

                  When you think of bowling, you might picture a casual night out with friends, rented shoes, and the
                  occasional strike. However, beneath the surface of this seemingly straightforward game lies a world of
                  precision, strategy, and technical skill that rivals any other sport. Bowling is far more than just
                  rolling
                  a ball down a lane; it's a complex dance of physics, mechanics, and human ingenuity.
                </p>

                <h3 class="blogSubHeading">The Anatomy of a Bowling Ball</h3>
                <p>
                  To the untrained eye, a bowling ball may appear as a simple, heavy sphere. In reality, each ball is a
                  marvel
                  of engineering. Modern bowling balls are designed with various core shapes and coverstock materials,
                  each
                  affecting how the ball behaves on the lane.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Core Design: The core, or the innermost part of the ball, can vary greatly in shape and density. These
                  variations influence the ball's rotation and trajectory. Some cores are symmetrical, providing a
                  smooth,
                  predictable roll, while asymmetrical cores can create more dynamic movement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Coverstock Material: The outer layer of the ball, known as the coverstock, is made from materials like
                  urethane, reactive resin, or particle. Each type interacts differently with the lane's surface and oil
                  patterns, affecting the ball's grip and hook potential.
                </p>

                <p>
                  You've probably noticed a bunch of folks on social media asking the same question: "How do I level up
                  my
                  bowling game?" It's a common query, and you'll get a different answer depending on who you ask. But
                  before we dive into the nitty-gritty, let's nail down what you're really after.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I could tell you to just get better at throwing the ball, or I could suggest dropping a grand on
                  all-new
                  bowling gear, hoping for a miracle improvement. But honestly, it doesn't quite work like that.
                </p>
                <p>
                  First off, let's get one thing straight: becoming a better bowler doesn't happen overnight. It's like
                  any sport; it takes a ton of practice and repetition. Depending on where you're starting, you might
                  even
                  see your scores dip and feel a bit lost before you start seeing real progress. It's part of the game.

                  In the dynamic world of bowling, keeping pace with technological advancements can be quite a
                  challenge. It's
                  like trying to catch a speeding train - new developments are constantly emerging. Imagine this: almost
                  every
                  month, we're seeing a fresh batch of bowling balls from various manufacturers. There's more - changes
                  in the
                  oil used on lanes, innovative gear for better ball release, wrist support, and perfecting the slide.
                  It's a
                  whirlwind of innovation, and you might wonder, "When does it all stop?"
