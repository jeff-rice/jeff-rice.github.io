        "content": "<p>As a high school bowling coach, one of the most important—and often overlooked—skills I emphasize with my athletes is spare shooting. I've even dedicated entire practices to it. The challenge? Spares just don't carry the same thrill as throwing strike after strike. But if you want to be a better bowler, consistently converting spares is one of the fastest ways to level up your game.</p><p>Here's why I focus so much on it:</p><h3 class=\"mt-4 mb-3\">Small Changes, Big Impact</h3><p>Closing just one more frame per game can boost your score by up to 20 pins. Over the course of a series, that can mean a 10–15 pin improvement to your average. That kind of bump adds up quickly and can make a huge difference in tight matches.</p><h3 class=\"mt-4 mb-3\">Spares Build Better Bowlers</h3><p>Practicing spares sharpens key fundamentals like targeting, lane adjustments, and visualization. You might not be focused on hitting a perfect breakpoint or tracking ball motion through the pin deck, but you <em>do</em> need to think critically about your angles and make purposeful adjustments—especially when dealing with multi-pin leaves. That includes tough splits like the Big Four (4-6-7-10), the 7-10 split, or the Greek Church (4-6-7-9-10). In those cases, the goal isn't necessarily to convert the spare—though it's great if you do—but to maximize pin count. Getting two or three pins is always better than walking away with an open frame.</p><p>Spare shooting forces you to use the whole lane and think critically about your execution. As <em>Bowler's Journal</em> puts it, \"Making various spares requires throwing the ball toward all sections of the pindeck... being able to visually assess where the ball is on the lane is a very important asset\" (<em>Spare Shooting: A Master Class</em>, March 2025, p. 24).</p><h3 class=\"mt-4 mb-3\">Even the Pros Rely on Spares</h3><p>In the same article, the <em>Journal</em> highlights how critical spare shooting is—even at the highest levels. During the PBA's 2025 Delaware Classic, several players averaged over 240 per game, yet avoiding open frames still proved to be a major factor in their success. Strikes might light up the scoreboard, but it's spare conversions that hold your game together.</p><h3 class=\"mt-4 mb-3\">Finding What Works</h3><p>There are many schools of thought when it comes to spare shooting: use a plastic ball, try urethane, or even learn a backup shot (though I don't recommend the last one—long-term wrist health matters). My rule of thumb? Use whatever method you can repeat safely and consistently. But no matter what you choose, there's no shortcut: you have to put in the practice.</p><p>Norm Duke—one of my all-time favorite bowlers—didn't use a spare ball. He had mastered his release so well that he could pick up spares with his strike ball. And while I doubt he perfected that overnight (Norm, if you did, my apologies), it took serious work to develop that level of control and consistency.</p><h3 class=\"mt-4 mb-3\">My Approach</h3><p>Personally, I go with a plastic ball. For me, it simplifies things—I don't want to factor in lane transitions or ball motion variables more than I have to. I know my target, I know the shot I want to make, and if I execute properly, I trust the spare will fall. Some might call it lazy—I call it repeatable.</p><p>One day at practice, I was lining up for a 10-pin and turned around immediately after my release because I <em>knew</em> it was good. My bowlers stared at me like I was crazy, but I told them: with enough practice, you'll know when you've thrown a good ball. That kind of confidence only comes from reps.</p><h3 class=\"mt-4 mb-3\">Why It Matters</h3><p>Let's face it—most of us aren't bowling 300 games every time out. For the average league bowler, the odds of a perfect game are around 1 in 11,500. So unless perfection is your norm, you <em>have</em> to be able to pick up spares. That's where consistency lives. That's where games are won—or lost.</p><p>It's an old saying, but it holds true: <strong>Strikes win games, spares win championships.</strong></p>",

        "content": "<p>One of the greatest joys in my coaching and personal life has been watching my daughter, Addyson, grow up immersed in the world of bowling. From her earliest days on the lanes with bumpers to the impressive accomplishments she's earned as a young competitor, her journey has been full of memories that remind me why I love this sport—and why I'm committed to sharing it with others.</p><p>Addyson has earned her place in the bowling community. She's a two-time Sectional Champion for high school girls, a two-time Jr. Gold qualifier, KYSTS plastic ball champion, and an all-city team honoree for the past two years. Now, as the captain of her high school team, she leads others with the same determination and love for the game that I've seen in her from the start. But beyond the titles and trophies, it's the moments we've shared on the road and at the lanes that have defined her journey.</p><p>We've traveled all over Indiana for tournaments, with some stops in Kentucky, each trip an adventure filled with excitement, preparation, and that unique anticipation only a bowling tournament can bring. These journeys have given us opportunities to explore new places and face different competitors, adding a layer of experience that's been invaluable in her development.</p><p>One trip, however, stands out more than most. We traveled to Elkhart, Indiana, for a grueling eliminator-style tournament. The format was demanding: six games to start, with cuts after every round—six games, then four, then two, all the way to a final step-ladder for the top four. Addyson bowled her heart out, advancing through every cut, but by the later rounds, the fatigue was visible. She'd glance at me between frames with a look that said, I'm ready for this to be over. But each time, they'd call the names for the next round, and there she was, still in the running.</p><p>She pushed through that day, finishing in an impressive third place. Although it's not an experience she likes to revisit, it's a testament to her resilience. She and her friend, who was also competing, joked afterward that they'd experienced a \"mental breakdown\" together due to the exhaustion—a bonding moment that sealed their friendship. That day may have been physically and mentally challenging, but it's one of those stories we look back on with a mix of pride and humor.</p><p>These experiences have been more than milestones in her competitive journey; they've been powerful moments in our relationship and in her growth as an athlete. I'm proud of her accomplishments, but even more, I'm proud of her determination, her willingness to push through tough days, and her love for the sport.</p><p>As her high school coach for the past three years, I feel privileged to be part of her journey and to see how far she's come. Each tournament, each road trip, and each frame she bowls are memories I'll cherish. It's my hope that her journey inspires other young bowlers to embrace the sport with the same passion and resilience that she brings to the lanes.</p>",

        "content": "<p class=\"lead\"><em>A reflection on the growth, community, and quiet power of youth bowling</em></p><p>I started bowling when I was 13 years old. Back then, it was just something I loved to do—me, the lanes, and the satisfying crash of pins. I never imagined that decades later, I'd be standing behind those same lanes, not as a player, but as a coach—guiding kids through a sport that has given me so much.</p><p>For the past six years, I've had the privilege of coaching middle school bowlers, and for the last four, high school athletes as well. Each season brings a new group of kids, a new set of challenges, and new stories I'll carry with me for a lifetime. Every year I've coached middle school, at least one individual—or a full team—has advanced to the state finals. But it's not the titles or trophies that make me proud. It's watching a kid light up after picking up their first spare. It's the quiet high-fives between teammates after a tough frame. It's the look of determination when they line up their shot, knowing they've put in the work.</p><h3 class=\"mt-4 mb-3\">Finding Their Footing</h3><p>Middle school bowling is where most of these kids start to figure out who they are. Some walk in with confidence; many don't. But little by little, they find their footing. They learn to trust their swing, their team, and—most importantly—themselves. It's more than form and follow-through. It's character development in motion.</p><p>High school bowling adds layers. The skill level rises, the stakes are higher, and suddenly it's not just about bowling—it's about leadership, communication, and resilience. Practices turn into strategy sessions. Matches feel like battles. And yet, the core remains the same: growth.</p><h3 class=\"mt-4 mb-3\">A Personal Journey</h3><p>One of the most personal parts of this journey has been watching my own daughter grow through the sport. She started out shy—soft-spoken, hesitant. But bowling gave her something to belong to. Through seasons of ups and downs, she found her voice. She found her people. And she eventually became captain of her high school team. I've seen her lead, support, and lift up others in ways that only this sport—and the community around it—could have nurtured.</p><p>Bowling is often misunderstood—seen as a casual activity rather than a serious sport. But spend a little time around these young athletes, and that perception changes quickly. You'll see discipline, heart, perseverance, and a whole lot of teamwork.</p><h3 class=\"mt-4 mb-3\">Beyond the Score</h3><p>If you've never been to a high school bowling match, I encourage you to check one out. Keep an eye out for the next local competition, walk in with an open mind, and soak in the experience. You'll hear the cheers, feel the energy, and witness the kind of camaraderie that doesn't show up on a scoreboard.</p><p>What makes bowling so special is that sense of community. You'll see opposing teams bowling side-by-side—competing, yes—but also cheering each other on. Sharing laughs, encouraging great shots, lifting each other up in tough frames. It's a culture of respect, support, and connection that's hard to find in other sports.</p><p>Bowling creates a family, not just a team. And once you're part of that family, it sticks with you.</p><p>I coach because bowling changed my life. And now, I get to help it do the same for others.</p>",

        "content": "<p class=\"lead\"><em>Stop Searching for Quick Fixes — Start Seeking Real Coaching</em></p><p>The other day, I was scrolling through Reddit threads about bowling — something I like to do every now and then to see what questions bowlers are asking. There were some genuinely good questions out there from people who truly wanted to get better. But what caught my attention (and honestly, frustrated me a little) were the answers.</p><p>A lot of the responses were things like:</p><ul><li><em>“Try to throw a hook.”</em></li><li><em>“You should go two-handed.”</em></li><li><em>“Buy this ball.”</em></li><li><em>“Just bowl more tournaments.”</em></li></ul><p>Now, don’t get me wrong — there’s nothing <em>wrong</em> with some of those ideas in the right context. If you’ve been bowling for a while and you’re looking to expand your experience, entering tournaments can be great. But for someone who’s still learning to line up properly, hit their target, or repeat a shot? Those quick tips can actually make things more confusing, not less.</p><h2 id=\"crowdsourced-coaching\">The Problem with “Crowdsourced Coaching”</h2><p>Bowling communities online are full of passionate people, but passion doesn’t always equal good advice. What I see too often are bowlers trying to help other bowlers — but without understanding the “why” behind the game. A new bowler doesn’t need to know how to throw a bigger hook; they need to learn how to build a repeatable shot. They don’t need to spend $250 on the newest ball; they need to understand how to make their current ball work for them.</p><p>It’s like trying to learn how to play guitar by asking Reddit what kind of strings you should buy — you might get some good answers, but none of it helps if you don’t yet know how to form a chord.</p><h2 id=\"why-coach-matters\">Why Finding a Coach Matters</h2><p>As a <strong>USBC Silver Level Coach</strong>, I’ve worked with bowlers of all skill levels — from brand-new youth bowlers to seasoned high school athletes. What I’ve seen time and again is that progress happens fastest when a bowler has someone who can meet them where they are.</p><p>A coach helps you understand <em>why</em> your ball hooks too early, <em>why</em> you miss your target, or <em>why</em> your release feels inconsistent. And more importantly, a good coach helps you find the small, practical steps to fix those things — not just throw a bigger hook or switch hands.</p><p>You don’t have to commit to a long-term coaching plan or spend hours every week working with someone. But even one or two sessions with a qualified coach can completely change how you understand your game. It’s the difference between trying random fixes versus actually learning how to bowl better.</p><h2 id=\"quick-vs-true\">Quick Answers vs. True Improvement</h2><p>I get it — everyone wants quick improvement. But real progress in bowling (just like in life) doesn’t come from shortcuts. It comes from learning, practicing with purpose, and having someone in your corner who knows how to guide you through the process.</p><p>So the next time you find yourself scrolling through online advice or wondering what ball to buy, consider finding a coach instead. Whether it’s a one-time session or a recurring partnership, a coach can help you see what you can’t see on your own — and that’s where true growth starts.</p><hr><h3 id=\"cta\">Ready to Take the Next Step?</h3><p>If you’re serious about improving your game and want guidance that’s tailored to <strong>you</strong>, I’d love to help. Whether you’re just starting out or looking to fine-tune your approach, I offer individualized coaching sessions designed to meet bowlers where they are — no gimmicks, no shortcuts, just honest instruction focused on progress.</p><p>You can <a href=\"/pages/contact.html\" rel=\"noopener\">contact me here</a> or visit the <a href=\"/pages/contact.html\" rel=\"noopener\">Coaching</a> page on my site to schedule a session or ask questions.</p><p><a class=\"btn btn--primary\" href=\"/pages/contact.html\" aria-label=\"Schedule a coaching session with Jeff Rice\">Schedule a Coaching Session</a></p>",

    "content": "<p>Real improvement in bowling doesn't come from magic tricks or expensive equipment—it comes from focused, intentional practice. Over my years coaching youth and high school bowlers, I've seen countless athletes transform their games not by chasing the latest ball release or trying to copy pro bowlers, but by committing to fundamental drills that build muscle memory, balance, and confidence.</p><p>The five drills below are my go-to exercises for bowlers at any level. Whether you're just starting out or you're a seasoned competitor looking to tighten up your mechanics, these drills will help you develop consistency, accuracy, and the kind of repeatability that wins matches. Each drill targets specific aspects of your game, and together, they create a well-rounded practice routine that addresses timing, balance, release quality, spare shooting, and lane play awareness.</p><p>Let's dive in.</p><hr><h3>1) The 1-Step Drill</h3><p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Timing, leverage, and a stable finish position.</p><p><strong>How:</strong> Start one step behind your normal slide position. Hold the ball in front of you as if the pushaway has already happened—ball at about waist height, arms extended. Now take one smooth, controlled slide step to the foul line and release the ball. The key is synchronizing your slide foot with your swing so that both arrive at the line at the same time.</p><p><strong>Focus:</strong> Keep your head still and eyes locked on your target throughout the entire motion. Your slide and swing should feel like one fluid movement, not two separate actions. Hold your finish position—balanced on your slide foot, opposite arm extended for balance—until the ball makes contact with the pins. This forces you to commit to a stable, controlled finish rather than falling off the shot or pulling up early.</p><p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> The 1-step drill strips away the complexity of a full approach and lets you focus entirely on the most critical moment: the release. By eliminating the first three or four steps, you remove variables and can zero in on balance, leverage, and timing at the line. This drill is particularly valuable for bowlers who tend to rush their approach or who struggle with timing issues.</p><p><em>Coach note:</em> I use this drill constantly with my high school team. It's especially effective for bowlers who \"run to the line\" or lose their balance at release. When you only have one step, you're forced to be patient and controlled. Start with 10-15 repetitions, focusing on identical finishes every time. If you're wobbling or falling off balance, slow down even more.</p><hr><h3>2) The Release (Foul-Line) Drill</h3><p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Clean, consistent release and roll pattern.</p><p><strong>How:</strong> Stand at the foul line in your finished slide position—knee bent, shoulders square to your target, weight on your slide foot. Hold the ball at your side in the bottom of your swing arc. Now let the ball swing freely forward and release it just past the foul line with a soft, controlled landing. The ball should roll smoothly down the lane without bouncing or skidding excessively.</p><p><strong>Focus:</strong> Your hand should stay behind and through the ball during the release—not around it, not on top of it. Think of your thumb exiting first, followed by your fingers lifting through the ball to create rotation. Pay attention to how the ball lands on the lane. A quiet, soft landing indicates good leverage and a clean release. A loud \"thud\" or excessive bounce means you're muscling it or dropping the ball rather than releasing it.</p><p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> This drill isolates the release itself—arguably the most important aspect of bowling. Without the momentum and complexity of a full approach, you can feel exactly what your hand is doing at the point of release. You'll quickly notice inconsistencies in your release angle, thumb exit, or finger lift. Recording yourself in slow motion (even just with your phone) during this drill can be incredibly revealing.</p><p><em>Coach note:</em> I often pair this drill with video review. Have someone film you from behind and to the side so you can see your hand position at release and how the ball lands on the lane. Look for a consistent release point and smooth roll. If you're struggling with hook or carry, this drill will help you identify whether the issue is in your release mechanics.</p><hr><h3>3) Spare Shooting Circuit</h3><p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Accuracy, frame control, and building confidence in pressure situations.</p><p><strong>How:</strong> Select five common spare leaves that you encounter regularly. I recommend: 10-pin, 7-pin, 3-6-10 (washout), 2-4-5 (bucket), and 1-2-4-7 (baby split or cluster). Set up at each leave and shoot 2-3 balls at each one, tracking your make percentage. Don't just count makes—pay attention to <em>how</em> you're making them. Are you hitting your target consistently? Is your ball speed the same on every shot?</p><p><strong>Focus:</strong> Consistent targeting and repeatable speed. If you're using the 3-6-9 spare system (or any other system), stick to it. Don't freelance. The goal is to build a systematic, reliable approach to every spare. Use a spare ball (plastic or low-hook urethane) whenever possible to eliminate lane transition and ball motion variables. Your spare shot should be mechanical—almost boring. That's a good thing.</p><p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> Spares are the foundation of consistent scoring. You can throw 10 strikes in a row and still lose to someone who throws 8 strikes and converts all their spares. This drill builds both the mechanical skill and the mental confidence to convert under pressure. By tracking your percentage, you create accountability and measurable improvement over time.</p><p><em>Coach note:</em> I tell my bowlers to treat spares like free throws in basketball—calm, repeatable, unemotional. Don't overthink them. Have a system, trust your system, and execute. If you're making less than 85% of single-pin spares in practice, that's your biggest opportunity for scoring improvement. I recommend running this circuit at least once a week. Keep a log of your make percentages and watch them climb over time.</p><p><strong>Advanced variation:</strong> Once you're consistently making 90%+ of your standard spares, add pressure. Set a goal like \"make 5 in a row\" or \"make 8 out of 10.\" This simulates the pressure of needing a spare in a close match.</p><hr><h3>4) Strike-From-Every-Arrow</h3><p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Versatility, lane play awareness, and developing multiple angles of attack.</p><p><strong>How:</strong> Start by targeting the first arrow (5 board) and attempt to strike from that line. Then move one arrow to the left (to the 10 board) and strike from there. Continue moving left, one arrow at a time, until you've thrown from every arrow across the lane. The challenge is adjusting your speed, loft, axis rotation, and laydown point to create the right ball motion from each angle.</p><p><strong>Focus:</strong> Pay close attention to how your ball motion changes as your angle changes. Steeper angles (from the left side) require different energy and rotation than straighter shots (from the right side for righties). Note which arrows and shapes feel most natural for your release and equipment. This is incredibly valuable information for making adjustments during competition when lanes transition.</p><p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> Most bowlers find a comfort zone and stay there. This drill forces you out of that comfort zone and teaches you to be versatile. When lanes break down or oil patterns shift, you'll have the experience and confidence to move and adapt. Plus, it deepens your understanding of how angle, speed, and rotation work together to create ball motion.</p><p><em>Coach note:</em> I'll be honest—this drill isn't for everyone, especially not for brand-new bowlers. It requires a solid foundation of fundamentals and some experience reading ball motion. But for intermediate to advanced bowlers, it's incredibly educational. Don't worry about making every shot; the goal is exploration and learning. You'll probably discover that you can strike from angles you never thought possible. And when you get into tough lane conditions in tournaments, you'll draw on this experience.</p><p><strong>Coaching tip:</strong> Take notes during this drill. Which arrows felt comfortable? Which required dramatic adjustments? What did you learn about your ball's reaction at different angles? This information becomes part of your \"bowling toolbox\" that you can draw from in competition.</p><hr><h3>5) Balance Line Hold</h3><p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Finish stability, posture control, and building a strong foundation at the line.</p><p><strong>How:</strong> Start without a ball. Take your full approach and hold your finish position for three full seconds. Your slide foot should be planted firmly, knee bent, shoulders level, and your opposite arm extended for balance. Your head should be still, with your eyes focused on your target. Once you can consistently hold a balanced finish without the ball, add the ball and repeat with slow, controlled shots—still holding your finish for three seconds.</p><p><strong>Focus:</strong> Pay attention to where your weight is distributed. It should be centered over your slide foot, not leaning back or falling forward. Your shoulders should be level—not tilted. Your knee should have flex in it, not locked out. And your head should remain still throughout the finish and hold. A common issue I see is bowlers who \"pop up\" after release or fall off to one side. This drill forces you to finish tall and stable.</p><p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> A stable finish position is the signature of a good bowler. It indicates proper balance, leverage, and control throughout the entire approach. When you can hold a balanced finish, it means your timing is correct, your swing is free, and your body is working in sync. Plus, a good finish gives you better accuracy and more consistent ball roll.</p><p><em>Coach note:</em> This is one of the first drills I teach new bowlers, but it's valuable for advanced players too. I'll often have my team run through this drill before matches as part of their warm-up routine. It gets them focused on their fundamentals and sets the tone for controlled, balanced bowling. If you're falling off your shots during competition, come back to this drill. It resets your foundation.</p><p><strong>Self-assessment:</strong> Record yourself doing this drill. Can you hold a perfectly still, balanced finish for three seconds? Or are you wobbling, stepping out, or losing your balance? The video doesn't lie. If you can't hold your finish in practice, you won't be able to hold it when it matters.</p><hr><h3>Putting It All Together: Building a Practice Routine</h3><p>These drills work best when incorporated into a regular practice routine. I recommend dedicating 10-15 minutes to drills at the beginning of every practice session, before you move into full approaches or open bowling. Here's a sample 30-minute practice structure I use with my team:</p><ul><li><strong>5 minutes:</strong> Balance Line Hold (no ball) — 10 reps, focus on consistency</li><li><strong>5 minutes:</strong> Release Drill at the foul line — 15-20 releases, focus on soft landings</li><li><strong>5 minutes:</strong> 1-Step Drill — 15 reps, focus on timing and finish</li><li><strong>10 minutes:</strong> Spare Shooting Circuit — Work through 3-4 common spares</li><li><strong>5 minutes:</strong> Open bowling with focus on implementing what you practiced</li></ul><p>As you progress, rotate in the Strike-From-Every-Arrow drill once or twice a month to expand your versatility and lane play knowledge.</p><h3>Tracking Your Progress</h3><p>Improvement happens when you measure it. Keep a simple practice log where you track:</p><ul><li>Spare make percentages by leave type</li><li>Number of clean releases (soft landings) in the foul-line drill</li><li>Number of balanced finishes held for 3+ seconds</li><li>Notes on what felt good and what needs work</li></ul><p>Over time, you'll see patterns emerge. Maybe your 10-pin percentage climbs from 75% to 95%. Maybe your balance becomes rock-solid. These small wins compound into major improvements in your overall game.</p><h3>Final Thoughts</h3><p>Bowling is a sport of repetition and refinement. The bowlers who improve the fastest aren't necessarily the ones with the most natural talent—they're the ones who practice with purpose and focus on fundamentals. These five drills have helped hundreds of my students build consistency, confidence, and competitive success. They'll do the same for you if you commit to them.</p><p>Remember: strikes are flashy, but fundamentals win championships. Put in the work on these drills, and you'll see the results on the scoreboard.</p><p>Want a personalized practice plan tailored to your specific needs?
